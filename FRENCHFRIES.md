           French Fries Recipe

 
 1) Take some fresh & big potatoes.

 2) Wash the potatoes, scrubbing them well, and dry completely.

 3) Peeling is optional.

 4) We have to cut the same & thats someting which is main. You can use kitchen mandoline for the same. If it is not available cut  each potato in half the long way, lay the cut side flat on the cutting surface, and cut into 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch slices. Stack these  slices and cut them into the same width sticks to make matchstick fries. Repeat with the remaining potatoes.
 
5) Put the cut potatoes in a large bowl and cover with cool water. Soak for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour. This step gets rid of excess starch, resulting in fluffier and crispier fries.

6) Drain the potato sticks and pat them dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Arrange them in a single layer to air-dry for a bit. The drier they are before frying, the better.

7) Bring at least 2 inches of oil in a large heavy pot to 325 F. Once the oil is hot, fry the potatoes for about 5 minutes. Work in batches if you're making more than one or two potatoes' worth. Adding too many fries at one time will bring down the temperature of the oil and cause soggy fries. The fries should be cooked through but still as pale as they were when you put them in the oil.

 8) Lift the fries out of the oil using a slotted spoon or spider. Drain them on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet or on layers of clean paper towels. Let sit until completely cool—at least 30 minutes and up to several hours.
At this point, you can stash the fries in the fridge and finish frying them the next day. Let them warm up a bit before frying again.

9) Bring the oil up to the 350 F to 375 F range. Use a thermometer or test the oil by dropping a fry in it—the oil should immediately sizzle around the fry actively but not violently. If it sputters and sizzles aggressively, bring the temperature down until you get an immediate and active yet steady sizzle when you add a fry to the oil.

10)Add the fries, working in batches if needed to keep them in a single layer in the oil, and cook until golden or starting to turn golden brown, depending on how well done you like your fries—about 5 minutes.

11) Once done, remove the fries from the oil. Drain them on a cooling rack set over a pan or on layers of paper towels. If you're salting your fries, season them while they are draining and still hot.
